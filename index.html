			<h2>biography</h2>
			<p>
				Michael Faraday was born in Newington, Surrey, England to a blacksmith father and a mother from
				the countryside

				 His family were members of a non-Anglican Christian sect that emphasized
				scriptural adherence and dissented against organizational structures of a church that were not
				clearly outlined biblically. Faraday believed in these principles, was strongly religious, and 
				participated actively in a congregation throughout his life.
			</p>
			<p>
				He only received a basic education in his youth. He learned to read and write in Sunday school
				but didn’t have the opportunity to study mathematics in detail

				Despite this disadvantage,
				Faraday was able to further his learning while apprenticing as a bookbinder for seven years
				starting at the age of fourteen. He would read the books from the shop focusing on the topics
				of science and had a preference for poring over anything that discussed electricity.				
			</p>
			<p>
				At 20 years old, Faraday went to a lecture series by renowned chemist Sir Humphry Davy.
				Faraday consolidated his own notes on the lectures, bound them, and sent the book to Davy.
				Davy was so impressed that he offered Faraday a position as his laboratory assistant at the
				Royal Institution of Great Britain. It was during this opportunity that Faraday learned a
				great deal about chemistry and experimental techniques.				
			</p>
			<p>
				After his apprenticeship with Davy, Faraday obtained his own position at the Royal Institution
				as an investigator. Because of his chemical prowess, he also consulted for large, industrial
				enterprises and served as an expert witness on chemical evidence in trials. He discovered
				new chemicals like benzene and invented the first iteration of the Bunsen burner. He married
				Sarah Barnard, joined the Sandemanian church, and served as a deacon.
			</p>
			<p>
				Of all his accomplishments, Faraday is most famous for his work with electricity and magnetism.
				Faraday was fascinated by the discovery of contemporary scientists that a current carrying wire
				produces a circular magnetic field around it. Faraday took advantage of this phenomenon to create
				the first successful electric motor.				
			</p>
			<p>
				Faraday continued to work on theories and experiments in electromagnetism until 1839 when he
				suffered a nervous breakdown as well as developed a physical disability hampering his ability
				to walk. It has been theorized that he may have suffered from poisoning from mercury which he
				utilized heavily in his experimentation.				
			</p>
			<p>
				He returned to his work in 1845. He was offered knighthood by Queen Victoria but declined it
				preferring not to collect honorific titles and excess wealth citing his religious principles.
				He did however accept the use of a home at Hampton Court near his laboratory. He refused on
				ethical grounds to advise the British government on the development of chemical weapons during
				the Crimean War. He turned down the offer to be buried at Westminster Abbey, and when he died
				in 1867 he was instead interred at Highgate Cemetery in a special section for those who
				dissented against the Anglican church.

			<h3>electrolysis</h3>
			<p>
				Faraday's experiments in electrochemistry led him to summarize the natural rules
				that govern electrolysis in two statements that are now known as Faraday's laws of electrolysis.
				They are 
				<a
					href="#ref-02"
					title="Williams, L. P. (2021, September 18). Michael Faraday. Encyclopædia Britannica. Retrieved September 22, 2021, from Encyclopedia Britannica"	
				>
					[2]</a>
				<ol>
					<li>
						The amount of chemical change produced by a current at the electrode-electrolyte
						interface is linearly proportial to the amount of electricity used.
					</li>
					<li>
						The amounts of chemical change produced by the same amount of electricity
						in different species is directly proportional to each species' equivalent weight.
					</li>
				</ol>
			</p>
			<p>
				The meaning of these laws is best illustrated with an example.
				Consider the illustration of an electrolytic cell below.
			</p>
			<img id="electrolysis-figure" src="images/electrolytic-cell.svg" alt="an electrolytic cell with an iron(II) sulfate solution">
			<p>
				A DC voltage source is connected to electrodes that are placed in an aqueous
				solution of iron (II) sulfate.
				The positive end of battery is connected to the anode which becomes positively charged.
				The negative end of the battery is connected to the cathode which becomes negative.
				If you look up sulfate in a reference for polyatomic ions, you will see that
				it always has a charge of 2-. FeSO<sub>4</sub> dissociates in aqueous solution
				into Fe<sup>2+</sup> and SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> ions.
				The positive Fe<sup>2+</sup> ions will be attracted to the negative cathode.
				Electrons from the cathode will combine with the Fe<sup>2+</sup> ions and reduce
				the iron atoms' charge in a reduction reaction.
				The iron will then stick to the cathode which we call plating.
			</p>
			<p>
				Let's apply the concepts in Faraday's law in a numerical example.
				What if want to collect 8 g of iron from the iron (II) sulfate solution in 3 hours?
				What current do we need to provide in the electrolysis process to plate this
				much iron on the cathode in the electrolytic cell?
			</p>
			<p>
				First let's write the balanced reduction reaction of of iron (II) ions.
			</p>
			<p id="reduction-reaction">
				Fe<sup>2+</sup> + 2e<sup>-</sup> → Fe 
			</p>
			<p>
				What this means is that for every mol of iron you want plated you will need
				2 mols of electrons. Now we can do some stoichiometric and dimensional analysis
				to determine how much current is required to plate 8 g of iron.
			</p>
			<img id="stoic-calc-small" src="images/stoic-calc-small.svg" alt="a calculation of the current needed to plate 8 g of iron">
			<img id="stoic-calc-big" src="images/stoic-calc-big.svg" alt="a calculation of the current needed to plate 8 g of iron">
			<p>
				This is quite a tedious calculation but let's explain what is happening in each step.
				We know we want to plate 8 g of iron so that is at the beginning of the calculation on the left.
				Most of the steps here are simply unit conversion.
				The second step is to divide by the molar mass of iron which was obtained from a periodic table.
				Next is the stoichiometric step where we use the fact that for every one mol of iron
				that is produced we need 2 mols of electrons according to the reduction reaction shown above.
				In the next step, we convert from mols of electrons to number of electrons using Avogadro's number.
				Then in the next step we convert from electrons to amount of charge in coulombs, C.
				Next we convert from C to ampere seconds, A s.
				Then we convert from seconds to hours, hr.
				Finally, we can divide by the amount of hours that we plan to apply the unknown current.
				If you can cancel all like units on the top and bottom, we are left only with A
				which indicates that this is a correct calculation of the current.
				We find that we will need to apply a current of 2.5 A for 3 hours to plate 8 g of Fe
				in our electrolytic cell.

			<h3>diamagnetism</h3>
			<p>
				Before Faraday's discovery of diamagnetism, paramagnetism was a known effect.
				Permanent magnets always are magnetized and will have the expected magnetic properties.
				However, materials that are not magnets will become temporarily magnetic
				in the presence of an external magnetic field 
				<a
					href="#ref-03"
					title="R. A. Serway, R. J. Beichner, and J. W. Jewett, Physics For Scientists and Engineers (Saunders College Publishing, Fort Worth, 1999)."

				[3]</a>.
				Paramagnetic materials are slightly attracted to magnets. This effect arises
				because atoms with unpaired electrons have a tiny magnetic moment, μ, due to
				the magnetic moment of electrons as depicted below.
			</p>
			<img id="paramagnetism" src="images/paramagnetism.svg" alt="an unpaired electron creates a magnetic moment">
			<p>
				The magnetic moment of electrons is a result of the spin and orbital angular momentum
				of the charged electrons in their orbitals around the nucleus.
				These properties of the electron act like a tiny current, I, which produces a magnetic
				field and thus they have a magnetic moment.
			</p>
			<p>		
				For an atom where all the electrons are in pairs, these magnetic moments cancel each other
				because the paired electrons have opposite spins and the atom has a net zero magnetic moment.
				If the atom has an odd number of electrons, then one electron will be unpaired.
				The atom will have a net magnetic moment and will act like a tiny magnet.
				If the north pole of a magnetic is brought toward a sample of paramagnetic material,
				the south poles of the atoms will be attracted to the magnet and the north poles
				will be repelled.
				The atoms will turn because of this and the magnetic moments of the atoms will all start
				to line up.
				They will not perfectly line up because thermal fluctations will also affect them
				and change their orientation.
				But they will be slightly aligned because of the magnet.
			</p>
			<p>
				Macroscopically, the material will now be slightly magnetic with a magnetization
				in the direction of the magnetic moments of the atoms. Just like the south poles of
				the electrons have become oriented closer to the magnet, the paramagnetic material
				will develop a south pole on it's side closer to the magnet.
				It will be attracted to the magnet and may draw closer to it barring other stronger
				forces on the sample.
			</p>
			<p>
				Paramagnetism is a very weak effect that causes materials to be attracted to magnets.
				This effect is due to the collective effect of the magentic moments
				of unpaired electrons in the atoms of some materials.
				What Faraday discovered through careful, sensitive experimentation is that
				some nonmagnetic materials are instead repelled by magnets.
				This effect is much weaker than paramagnetism.
				It arises because of an induced emf in the current loop of the electrons as
				a magnet is brought towards it.
				The changing magnetic flux through these current loops induces an emf
				which produces a magnetic field to oppose the change according to Lenz's law 
				<a
					href="#ref-04"
					title="D. J. Griffiths, Introduction to Electrodynamics (Prentice-Hall Inc., Upper Saddle River, 1999)."
				>
					[4]</a>.
				If you have a material with no unpaired electrons, then all electrons
				are in pairs of two that are like two current loops with currents in
				opposite direction or magnetic moments in opposite direction.
				One of these loops will have a magnetic moment in the same direction
				of the external magnetic field, B, as depicted below.
			</p>
			<img id="diamagnetism" src="images/diamagnetism.svg" alt="a pair of electrons can develop a magnetic moment in the presence of an external field">
			<p>
				An emf will be induced in this loop to oppose an increase in the magnetic flux.
				The current in this loop will decrease to oppose an increase in the flux.
				This also means the magnetic moment of the elctron will decrease.
			</p>
			<p>
				The other loop has a magnetic moment in the opposite direction
				of the external field.
				As the magnet approaches it will decrease the flux through the loop.
				This will cause an induced emf that responds by increasing the flux.
				The current will increase and increase the electron's magnetic moment
				to oppose a decrease in the flux.
				As a result the magnetic moments will no longer be equal.
				That means they no longer cancel eachother out, and there is a net magnetic moment
				in the atom and a net magnetization in the material.
				This magnetization points in the opposite direction of the external magnetic field.
				This is because the loop with a magnetic moment in the opposite direction increased
				and the loop with a magnetic moment in the same direction got smaller.
				So the material becomes a magnet with its north end pointing toward the north
				end of the permanent magnetic you brought towards it.
				These north ends will repel each other.
				Materials that undergo this process are called diamagnets
				and they are repelled by permanent magnets.
				Diamgnetism occurs in any material that has paired electrons so it
				actually occurs in all matter.
				Atoms with an unpaired electron in their valence will still have electron
				pairs in inner orbitals.
				Those pairs will create a diamagnetic effect.
				It's just that the paramgnetic effect is always much stronger
				so paramagnetic materials will always be attracted to magnets
				instead of repelled by them.
			</p>
			<h3>electromagnetic induction</h3>
			<p>
				Danish scientist, Hans Orsted made the discovery that a current carrying wire
				produces a circular magnetic field around it.
				After this revelation, many scientists including Faraday speculated
				whether a magnetic field could create a current.
				All experiments showed no results including Faraday's original attempts.
				That is until he took an iron ring, wrapped a wire coil around one side of the ring,
				and attached the coil to a battery. Then he wrapped a coil of wire around
				the other side of the ring and attached it to a galvanometer which measures current
				as depicted in the figure below.
			</p>
			<img id="electromagnetic-induction" src="images/electromagnetic-induction.svg" alt="An iron ring. A coil is wrapped around it on one side and attached to a battery. On the other side a coil is wrapped around it and attached to a galvanometer.">
			<p>
				He placed a switch between the battery and the coil wrapped around the ring.
				What he noticed is that the magnetic field produced by the battery-side coil
				did in fact induced a current on the galvanometer-side coil.
				However, it only did so for a brief moment when the switch was closed
				or when it was opened.
				What the result indicated was that only a changing magnetic field
				can induce a current.
				More specifically, an emf will be induced in a current loop
				to oppose any change in the magnetic flux throught the loop.
				This is Lenz's law which we used in our discussion of diamagnetism.

			<h2>impact</h2>
			<p>
				Faraday's work has influenced many fields and subjects from chemistry,
				to material engineering, to physics.
				The most important contribution is most likely his discovery
				of electromagnetic induction.
				His theorizing that a current is induced that opposes a change
				in the magnetif flux was crucial to the formulation of Maxwell's equations
				that completely describes the physics of electricity and magnetism.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you recall from the biography above, Faraday never received a strong
				mathematical education.
				Faraday took careful data but a lot of his laboratory notes, documentation,
				and publications are exclusively descriptive in nature without complex calculations.
				This is indicative of a strong intuitive understanding of the phenomena
				he was discussing without a need to rely on mathematical models
				to understand the physics.
				Others were able to synthesize Faraday's ideas into mathematical formalism
				and thus the third law of Maxwell's equations as shown below is called Faraday's law.
			</p>
			<img id="faradays-law" src="images/faradays-law.svg" alt="the curl of the electic field is the negative of the time rate of change of the magnetic field">
			<p>
				There is one more related contribution by Faraday that turned out to have
				a suprisingly important impact on our understanding of the world.
				Late in his life, Faraday filled in last minute for an absent guest lecturer
				at the Royal Institution of Great Britain

					[2]</a>.
				He decided to discuss his ideas about the the electromagnetic fields
				produced by atoms. He speculated that those fields might be the medium
				through which light waves propagate.
				This would turn out to be true and would heavily influence the ideas
				of James Clerk Maxwell who would prove this mathematically.
				This idea is the culminating result of the theory of electromagnetism
				and leads to special relativity.
				Albert Einstein kept a picture of Faraday in his office.
